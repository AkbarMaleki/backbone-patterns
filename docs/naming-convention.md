# Naming convention

Classes often start in uppercase letters, while instances start with lowercase
letters. This is a throwback of the general Python and Ruby practice of having
constant names start with uppercase letters.

``` javascript
// Classes:
Photo
Album
Author

// Instances:
photo
myAlbum
```

For names with multiple words, JavaScript often calls for CamelCase. Using
underscores are discouraged in JavaScript.

``` javascript
// Good (CamelCase):
PhotoAlbum
albumCover

// Avoid (under_scores):
photo_album
album_cover
```
